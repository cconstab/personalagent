# Context Storage Migration - Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully migrated context storage from shared (with agent) to self-owned (private to user).

## Changes Made

### 1. App Code Updates (`app/lib/services/at_client_service.dart`)

Updated all context storage operations to use `sharedWith = null` instead of `sharedWith = _agentAtSign`:

- ✅ `storeContext()` - Saves context as self-owned
- ✅ `_getAllContextWithFlags()` - Reads from self-owned key
- ✅ `toggleContextEnabled()` - Updates self-owned key
- ✅ `deleteContext()` - Deletes self-owned key

### 2. Migration Tool Created

**New Files:**
- `tools/delete_shared_context.dart` - Standalone Dart program to delete old shared keys
- `tools/pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies for the migration tool
- `tools/README.md` - Detailed tool documentation
- `migrate_context.sh` - Easy-to-use shell script launcher

**Tool Features:**
- Connects to user's @sign using existing credentials
- Searches for old shared context keys
- Shows what will be deleted
- Asks for confirmation
- Safely deletes old shared keys
- Preserves context data (recreated as self-owned by app)

### 3. Documentation

**New Documentation:**
- `docs/CONTEXT_MIGRATION.md` - Complete migration guide
  - Overview of changes
  - Why it matters (privacy/security)
  - Who needs to migrate
  - How to migrate (automatic vs manual)
  - Troubleshooting
  - FAQ
  - Technical details

## Usage

### For Users (Easy Way)

From project root:
```bash
./migrate_context.sh @youratSign @agentAtSign
```

### For Developers (Direct)

```bash
cd tools
dart pub get
dart run delete_shared_context.dart @youratSign @agentAtSign
```

### Show Help

```bash
cd tools
dart run delete_shared_context.dart --help
```

## Architecture Benefits

### Before
```
User Context (shared with agent)
    ↓
Agent can read directly from atPlatform
    ↓
Privacy concern: Agent has direct access
```

### After
```
User Context (self-owned, private)
    ↓
App reads and includes in conversation history
    ↓
Agent processes as part of conversation
    ↓
Better privacy: Agent only sees what app sends
```

## Key Points

1. **Backward Compatible**: App handles both old and new format gracefully
2. **No Agent Changes**: Agent code unchanged, doesn't need restart
3. **Non-Destructive**: Migration tool only deletes old shared keys
4. **Automatic Fallback**: If user doesn't migrate, app still works (creates new self-owned keys)
5. **Privacy First**: Context is now truly private to the user

## Testing

To verify the migration:

1. **Before running tool:**
   ```bash
   # Check if old shared key exists
   # (requires atPlatform CLI tools)
   ```

2. **Run migration:**
   ```bash
   ./migrate_context.sh @your @agent
   ```

3. **After migration:**
   - Open Personal Agent app
   - Check Context Management screen
   - Add/edit context
   - Verify it's saved as self-owned (check logs)
   - Send a query and verify agent receives context

## Files Modified

```
app/lib/services/at_client_service.dart
  - Lines 512, 555, 620, 665, 672: Changed sharedWith to null

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Code changes complete
2. ✅ Migration tool created
3. ✅ Documentation written
4. ⏭️ Test migration with real @sign
5. ⏭️ Update main README.md to reference migration guide
6. ⏭️ Consider adding migration prompt in app UI (future enhancement)

## Notes

- Tool requires existing `.atKeys` file
- Uses same authentication as main app
- Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)
- Old keys remain unused after app update (migration just cleans them up)
- App automatically creates new self-owned keys when context is next modified
