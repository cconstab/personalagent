# atPlatform Conversation Storage - Quick Summary

**Implementation Complete** ✅  
**Date**: October 15, 2025

## What Changed

Conversations now stored in **atPlatform** instead of local device storage (SharedPreferences).

## Key Benefits

1. **🌐 Cross-Device Sync**
   - Login on any device with your @sign
   - All conversations automatically available
   - Updates sync across all devices

2. **⏰ Auto-Expiration**
   - Conversations expire after 7 days of inactivity
   - TTL automatically refreshes when you use a conversation
   - Active conversations never expire

3. **🗑️ True Deletion**
   - Delete button removes conversation from atPlatform
   - Deleted conversations removed from all devices
   - Permanent and irreversible

4. **🔒 Secure & Private**
   - End-to-end encrypted
   - Only you can access your conversations
   - Stored as self keys (not shared with anyone)

## How It Works

### Storage Format
```
atKey: conversations.{conversationId}.personalagent@youratsign
TTL: 7 days (604,800,000 milliseconds)
Type: Self key (private to you)
```

### TTL Refresh
TTL resets to 7 days whenever you:
- Send a message ✅
- Receive an agent response ✅
- Rename the conversation ✅
- Clear messages ✅

### Cross-Device Example
```
MacBook: Create "Project Ideas" conversation
         ↓
    Save to atPlatform
         ↓
iPad:    Login → "Project Ideas" appears automatically
         ↓
iPad:    Add more messages
         ↓
    Save to atPlatform
         ↓
MacBook: Refresh → New messages appear
```

## New Files

- **`app/lib/services/conversation_storage_service.dart`**
  - Handles all atPlatform conversation storage
  - Save/load/delete operations
  - TTL management

## Updated Files

- **`app/lib/providers/agent_provider.dart`**
  - Replaced SharedPreferences with atPlatform storage
  - All saves now go to atPlatform
  - Async delete and rename operations

- **`app/lib/screens/conversations_screen.dart`**
  - Delete/rename buttons now async
  - Wait for atPlatform operations to complete

## User Experience

### Before (SharedPreferences)
- ❌ Conversations stuck on one device
- ❌ Lost if you switch devices
- ❌ No automatic cleanup
- ❌ Limited storage space

### After (atPlatform)
- ✅ Conversations follow you everywhere
- ✅ Available on all your devices
- ✅ Auto-cleanup after 7 days inactivity
- ✅ Generous storage capacity

## Testing

To verify it works:

1. **Test Storage**
   ```bash
   ./run_app.sh
   # Create conversations
   # Restart app
   # Conversations should reload from atPlatform
   ```

2. **Test Cross-Device** (if you have multiple devices)
   ```bash
   Device 1: Login → Create conversation
   Device 2: Login → Conversation appears!
   Device 2: Add messages
   Device 1: Restart → New messages appear!
   ```

3. **Test Deletion**
   ```bash
   # Create conversation
   # Delete it
   # Check other devices → Gone everywhere
   ```

## Migration Note

**Existing users**: Old conversations in SharedPreferences will not be migrated automatically. They will start with a clean slate. If needed, important conversations should be recreated.

## Conclusion

Conversations are now truly portable! 🎉

Use your Personal AI Agent on any device with your @sign, and all your conversations will be right there, automatically synchronized and securely stored in atPlatform.
